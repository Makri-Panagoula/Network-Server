Some things in general to consider :
    The inputeFile , tallyVotes , pollerResultFile , poll-log ,poll-stats have votes saved in the format : Name Surname PoliticalParty. In processLogFile.sh and tallyVotes.sh we check for differences between poll-stats and outputs of the scripts as the outcomes must be the same (except in tallyVotes in case of duplicates the thread execution makes it uncertain).I chose to consider main as my master thread.We get the soket descriptors from the buffer in a LIFO order.When we shutdown, we complete the client's requests we had already started executing as well as the pending ones in the buffer. We update both the log and the statistics file every time we get a new vote.

Synching in buffer is being achieved with two condition variables that are protected by buf_mtx , empty and full , where master thread(main) blocks while buffer is full and worker thread blocks while buffer is empty.We also have two seperate mutexes (for better time performance) for poll-log and poll-stat file and the data structures each uses , log_mtx and stat_mtx , that guarantee mutual exclusion for results accuracy when accessing them.
